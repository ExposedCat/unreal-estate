# Instructions
- Before editing a file, always, ALWAYS read it's most recent actual version!
- When you are asked a question, provide a precise answer, don't jump into conclusions
- Always write mindful, secure, scalable and production-ready code
- Always follow project guidelines
- Before doing any tasks, check relevant parts of the project to get some insights on how to approach the task
- Use only modern, reliable, typesafe libraries and frameworks
- Don't run dev mode or test any endpoints - leave it to the user
- For styles, always add it to `packages/client/src/theme.ts` and never hardcode any literal values
- Always use Bun API when possible
- Always fix diagnostics after each step

# Code Style Requirements
- Always use readable full names (e.g. use `error` instead of `e` or `err`, and similar)
- Never leave comments
- Always use `type` instead of `interface`
- Don't create types files. Put types whenever they make sense to be placed
- Don't put 'use *' on top of files
- Always write typesafe code without `any`
- Use `Link` or hooks from `@tanstack/react-router` instead of `<a>`
